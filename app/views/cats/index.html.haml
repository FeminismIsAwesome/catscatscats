      Quick Rules Reference
    %h2
      Start of Turn:
    %h3
      1): Either:
    %ul
      %li Play an action card from your hand
      %li Discard a card from your hand
    %h3
      2): Pick one of these actions
    %ul
      %li Harass one cat with love, placing 2 annoyed tokens, or two cats for 1 each
      %li Spend X-1 influence tokens, reduce X annoyed tokens from one cat
      %li Gain 1 token of any kind, including influence, VP, and bid tokens.
      %li Place a bid on a cat. This causes everyone to place a blind bid. Losing bids must still spend half of the influence, rounded down. Nobody wins ties.
    %h3
      3): If you have a cat with Perform: on it, you may annoy it by putting it on performance.
    %h6
      This means you put 2 annoyed tokens on it and gain its Perform effect. You cannot do this on a cat you won this round.
    %h6
      You may only do this to one cat per turn.

    %h4
      What happens if I end a turn with no cards?
    %h6
      Skip the first phase, but you still get the second phase.
