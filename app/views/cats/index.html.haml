      Quick Rules Reference
    %h2
      Start of Turn:
    %h3
      1): Either:
    %ul
      %li Play an action card from the pile.
      %li Discard a card an action card from the pile, perform 2 bonus actions.
    %h3
      2): Pick one of these actions
    %ul
      %li Harass one cat with love, placing 2 annoyed tokens, or two cats for 1 each. If a cat has more Annoyance tokens than the threshold, remove all Annoyance tokens from it and send it to the stray cat alley.
      %li Spend X-1 influence tokens, reduce X annoyed tokens from one cat
      %li Gain 1 token of any kind, including influence, VP, and bid tokens.
      %li Spend 1 influence token to place a bid on a cat. This causes everyone to place a blind bid. Losing bids must still spend half of the influence, rounded down. Nobody wins ties.
    %h3
      3): If you have a cat with Perform: on it, you may annoy it by putting it on performance.
    %h6
      This means you put 2 annoyed tokens on it and gain its Perform effect.
    %h6
      You may only do this to one cat per turn.
    %h3  4): Set Keyword
    %h6 This means when you play this card, gain the Action: effect. You can discard it for its Set: effect.op

      Errata/FAQ
    %h4
      What happens if two Reaction cards are played at once?
    %h6
      Resolve them in order via first player token taking preference, if order matters.
    %h4
      Can I do Perform on a cat if that would put them over the limit?
    %h6
      Yes, but then the cat would immediately go to the Stray bin.
